DOMAIN;google.com
it uses https
When I press Enter in the browser, the browser first reads the URL and figures out which server it needs to contact.
It then sends a request over the internet using protocols like HTTP or HTTPS. The request travels through networks and routers until it reaches the correct web server. 
The server processes the request, finds the requested page or data, and sends a response back to the browser. The browser receives this response, downloads the files (such as HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript), and interprets them. Finally, the browser renders everything on the screen so the webpage appears for the user.
