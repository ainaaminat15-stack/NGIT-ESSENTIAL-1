It is important for a web developer to understand computers because it helps them know how hardware and software work together to run applications. Knowledge of operating systems
allows developers to write, run, and troubleshoot programs efficiently across different environments. Understanding how the web works helps developers know how data moves between clients
and servers. This knowledge makes it easier to debug errors related to networks, servers, or browsers. It also helps developers make better decisions about performance, security, and 
compatibility.
Overall, these fundamentals make a developer more effective and confident before writing code.
