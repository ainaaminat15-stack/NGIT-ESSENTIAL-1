
1. Computer, Hardware, and Software

A computer is an electronic device that accepts data (input), processes it according to instructions, stores it, and produces output (information).

Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer you can touch.
Examples:

 Keyboard
 Monitor
 Hard disk / SSD

Software refers to programs and instructions that tell the computer what to do.
Examples:

 Windows OS
 Microsoft Word
 Google Chrome



 2. Operating System (OS)

An operating system is system software that manages computer hardware and provides services for application software.

Primary functions:

1. Manages hardware resources (CPU, memory, storage, devices).
2. Provides an interface for users to interact with the computer.



3. Differences Between Windows and Linux

 Windows                     | Linux                                   
 Proprietary (paid license)  | Open-source (mostly free)               
 User-friendly for beginners | More technical, preferred by developers 
 More vulnerable to viruses  | More secure and stable                  



 4. Explanation of Terms

File: A collection of data stored on a computer with a name (e.g., `report.docx`).
Folder (Directory): A container used to organize and store files and other folders.
File Extension: The suffix that indicates a file’s type (e.g., `.txt`, `.jpg`, `.exe`).


 5. Command Line

The command line is a text-based interface used to interact with the computer by typing commands.

Importance for developers:

 Faster and more powerful than graphical interfaces
 Used for automation, running programs, managing servers, and debugging



 6. Internet-Related Terms

Server: A computer that provides data or services to other computers (clients).
Browser: Software used to access and view websites (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
IP Address:A unique numerical identifier for a device on a network.
DNS (Domain Name System): Converts domain names into IP addresses.
HTTP:Protocol for transferring web data (not secure).
HTTPS: Secure version of HTTP that encrypts data.


 7. Client–Server Model

The client–server model is a network architecture where clients request services and servers provide them.

Example:
A web browser (client) requests a webpage, and a web server responds by sending the page.



8. Frontend vs Backend Development

Frontend: The visible part of a website users interact with (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
Backend: The server-side logic, database, and authentication (Python, Java, PHP, Node.js).



 9. Website, Domain, and Hosting

Website: A collection of related web pages.
Domain: The human-readable address of a website (e.g., `example.com`).
Hosting: The service that stores website files on a server.

How they work together:
The domain points to the hosting server where the website files are stored.


 10. Browser Rendering Process (Brief)

1. Browser requests the webpage from the server.
2. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are downloaded.
3. Browser builds the page structure (DOM & CSSOM).
4. Page is rendered and displayed to the user.
